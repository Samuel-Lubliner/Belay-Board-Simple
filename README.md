# Belay Board
Hello, my name is Sam Lubliner. I am a full stack software developer apprentice. I drew on my experience as a coach in the climbing industry to create a web application for scheduling climbing sessions and finding climbing partners.

## Pain points 
I want to climb, however I need to find a partner and coordinate availabilities.

If I go to the gym by myself, finding a climbing partner is challenging because there are so many different styles and preferences.

## Solution 
Find climbing partners and schedule climbing sessions with Belay Board!
